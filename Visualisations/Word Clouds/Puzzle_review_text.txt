In the raw reviews for the **"Puzzle"** genre, words like **"game"**, **"puzzle"**, **"play"**, **"fun"**, and **"time"** dominate, reflecting general gameplay enjoyment and experiences. Generic terms such as **"really"**, **"good"**, and **"great"** are common but lack specificity about puzzle game elements. References to notable games like **"Tetris"** and **"Puyo Puyo"** highlight iconic titles in this genre, but the raw text is cluttered with noise, including redundant and irrelevant terms, which dilute the insights.
