The analysis of raw reviews for the "Adventure" genre shows a dominance of broad terms like **"game"**, **"story"**, **"time"**, **"one"**, and **"play"**, reflecting general sentiments rather than specific insights. Frequent stop words such as **"one"**, **"really"**, and **"even"**, contribute to noise, diluting the relevance of meaningful terms like **"puzzle"** and **"character"**. While the raw text provides a high-level overview of player opinions, it lacks the depth needed to understand genre-specific preferences.
