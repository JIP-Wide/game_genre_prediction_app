In the raw reviews for the **"Shooter"** genre, words like **"game"**, **"time"**, **"story"**, **"play"**, and **"fun"** dominate, reflecting a general focus on gameplay and player enjoyment. Generic terms such as **"one"**, **"really"**, and **"good"** are prevalent, offering limited insight into specific shooter elements. References to key features like **"multiplayer"** and **"mission"**, along with mentions of iconic franchises like **"Call of Duty"** and **"Halo"**, hint at genre-specific aspects.
