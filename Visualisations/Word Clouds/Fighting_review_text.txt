In the raw reviews for the **"Fighting"** genre, words like **"game"**, **"character"**, **"time"**, **"story"**, and **"play"** dominate, reflecting a broad focus on general gaming aspects and enjoyment. Generic terms such as "one", **"even"**, **"good"**, and **"fun"** appear prominently but offer limited insight into the specific elements of fighting games. Non-standard words, references to specific game titles like **"Tekken"** and **"Mortal Kombat"**, and other irrelevant details contribute to the overall noise in the data. While some terms like **"fighting"** and **"combo"** hint at genre-specific features, the raw reviews lack depth, broadly summarizing the gaming experience without focusing on fighting-specific mechanics or features.
