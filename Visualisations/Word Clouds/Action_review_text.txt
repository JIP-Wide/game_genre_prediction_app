In the raw reviews, words like **"game"**, **"time"**, **"story"**, **"play"**, and **"fun"** dominate, reflecting a general focus on gaming and enjoyment. Generic terms like **"one"**, **"even"**, **"want"**, and **"now"** add noise without offering much insight. Non-standard words, punctuation, and references to specific game titles further dilute clarity. Overall, the raw reviews lack depth, with dominant words broadly describing the gaming experience rather than focusing on action-specific elements.
