In the raw reviews for the **"Platform"** genre, words like **"game"**, **"level"**, **"play"**, **"one"**, and **"time"** dominate, reflecting a general focus on gameplay and progression. Generic terms such as **"really"**, **"much"**, and **"better"** are prevalent, offering limited insight into platform-specific elements. References to notable titles like "Sonic" and "Mario" hint at iconic characters associated with the genre, but the raw data contains noise and redundant terms that dilute meaningful insights.
